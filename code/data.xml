	Holly Oyster is a (primarily) solo developer who specializes in creating retro aesthetics and meaty FPS action. Inspired by modern and classic FPS games alike, she aims to innovate within the genre while also paying homage to those who came before her.

	<histories>
		<history>
			<header>Early History</header>
			<text>Holly Oyster's long standing passion for creating video games spawned from a desire to put her amateurish illustrations into motion at age 13. Eight years after first opening RPG Maker MV, she now works primarily on 3D games in the Godot engine, specifically meaty and impactful retro styled shooters. Working primarily as a solo developer, she's had to develop skills in game design, 3D modeling/texturing/animation, programming, and more. She now works day in and day out in pursuit of turning her passion into a career.</text>
		</history>
		<history>
			<header>Recent History and Now</header>
			<text>Holly is currently developing her first commercial game, Venison County (a boomer shooter about black magic and deer people). Thanks to a custom OST made by her best friend since grade school, John Carter Wilson, and illustrations by her girlfriend of 6 years, Carlyle Skelton, Venison County is now available to playtest on Steam via an open beta. Venison County is on track to be released in October of 2026, and will hopefully be a well received first entry to her fledgling game catalogue.</text>
